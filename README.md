With this tool, you will be able to show your musical creations displayed as a gallery. You can add thumbnails to make it more visual.

How to use it ?

Put your audio files in ./public/songs (create folder if necessary)
Put your thumbnails in ./public/thumbnails (create folder if necessary)
(Note that thumbnails resolution is 4/3)

Create an object for each song in ./pubic/songs.json and make sure to respect the object model given in examples.

Your song gallery should now be working, and you can now easily show your musical productions on your website.
